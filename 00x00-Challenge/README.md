## Challenges

### Challenge 1: [First of all, introduction]

The first challenge  olamide-badoo.c is all about getting to know you. It's time you introduce yourself to the world.
This challenge requires you to print a text introducing yourself on a single line, and then print a string inputed by a user to stdout.
If you are not familiar with C, you may want to read about the printf() command.
