# CodeJamChallenge Repository

Welcome to the CodeJamChallenge repository! Here you'll find a collection of exciting coding challenges to sharpen your skills and have some fun. Feel free to explore, attempt the challenges, and contribute your solutions.

#NOTE
All the codes must be made betty compliant before being pushed to the repository.
All wrnings will be treated as compilation error.
No restriction in the UNix/Linux version or distro to be used
Do not use any form of AI technology to answer the questions. KIMBA has eyes on your code
Yes, you are to make the codes perfect but you are not allowed to change the codes but you must make sure they work.

## Challenges

### Challenge 1: [First of all, introduction]

The first challenge  olamide-badoo.c is all about getting to know you. It's time you introduce yourself to the world.
This challenge requires you to print a text introducing yourself on a single line, and then print a string inputed by a user to stdout.
If you are not familiar with C, you may want to read about the printf() command.

#### Sample case
input
First of all, introduction.

output
First of all, introduction.
Hi, I'm Darth Jade-i.  



### Challenge 2: [Guy, Where you dey?]

The second challenge, ni-ojuelegba.c is to test your navigation skills through the memory of your laptop.
Complete the function void update(int *a, int *b). It receives two integer pointers int *a and int *b. Set the value of a to their sum, and b to their absolute difference. (There is no return value, and no return statement is needed.)

#### Sample Case

The input will contain two integers, a and b, seperated by a newline.
Modify the two values in place and the code stub main() will print values.

input
4
5

output
9
1

Explanation
a = 4 + 5 = 9
b = |4 - 5| = 1

### Challenge 3: [I am the Greatest!!]

This third challenge, mohammed-ali.c, challenges your function integration skills.
Write a function int max_of_four(int a, int b, int c, int d) which reads four arguments and returns the greatest of them.

Note

There is no built in max function in C. Code that will be reused is often put in a separate function, e.g. int max(x, y) that returns the greater of the two values.



#### Sample Case
input
4
3
6
5

output
6


### Challenge 4: [Wakanda forever! Oh, wait, I mean looping forever! But hey, Wakanda's pretty cool too, right? Anyway, back to our loop-de-loop adventure! Looping forever!.]

This fourth challenge, lupita-nyogo.c, challenges your control flow skills.
Given a five digit integer, print the sum of its digits. In this challenge make sure to address every possible edge case.

#### Usage

Input Format

The input contains a single five digit number, .

Output Format

Print the sum of the digits of the five digit number.

input
10564

output
16

### Challenge 5: [Another One!!! Lupita again?]
The fifth challenge, dj-khalid.c, challenges your ability to use recursion. So the challenge is to solve the fourth challenge, [lupita-nyogo.c](https://github.com/dohoudanielaetheris/EventCodeJam/blob/main/00x00-Challenge/lupita-nyogo.c) using recursion. Just remember to rename it as dj-khalid.c



#### Sample case
same as challenge four
